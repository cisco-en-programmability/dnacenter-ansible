module: sda_fabrics_vlan_to_ssids_fabric_id_v1
short_description: Resource module for Sda Fabrics Vlan To Ssids Fabric Id V1
description:
  - Manage operation update of the resource Sda Fabrics Vlan To Ssids Fabric Id V1.
  - >
    Add, update, or remove SSID mappings to a VLAN. If the payload doesn't contain
    a 'vlanName' which has SSIDs
    mapping done earlier then all the mapped SSIDs of the 'vlanName' is cleared. The
    request must include all SSIDs
    currently mapped to a VLAN, as determined by the response from the GET operation
    for the same fabricId used in the
    request. If an already-mapped SSID is not included in the payload, its mapping
    will be removed by this API.
    Conversely, if a new SSID is provided, it will be added to the Mapping. Ensure
    that any new SSID added is a Fabric
    SSID. This API can also be used to add a VLAN and associate the relevant SSIDs
    with it. The 'vlanName' must be
    'Fabric Wireless Enabled' and should be part of the Fabric Site representing 'Fabric
    ID' specified in the API
    request.
