    description:
      - >
        StartTime query parameter. Start time from which API queries the data set
        related to the resource. It must
        be specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
    type: float
  endTime:
    description:
      - >
        EndTime query parameter. End time to which API queries the data set related
        to the resource. It must be
        specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
    type: float
  limit:
    description:
      - Limit query parameter. Maximum number of records to return.
    type: float
  offset:
    description:
      - >
        Offset query parameter. Specifies the starting point within all records returned
        by the API. It's one based
        offset. The starting value is 1.
    type: float
  sortBy:
    description:
      - SortBy query parameter. A field within the response to sort by.
    type: str
  order:
    description:
      - Order query parameter. The sort order of the field ascending or descending.
    type: str
  siteId:
    description:
      - >
        SiteId query parameter. The site UUID without the top level hierarchy. `siteId`
        is mandatory. `siteId` must
        be a site UUID of a building. (Ex."buildingUuid") Examples `siteId=buildingUuid`
        (single siteId requested)
        `siteId=buildingUuid1&siteId=buildingUuid2` (multiple siteId requested).
    type: str
  ssid:
    description:
      - >
        Ssid query parameter. In the context of a network application, SSID refers
        to the name of the wireless
        network to which the client connects. Examples `ssid=Alpha` (single ssid requested)
        `ssid=Alpha&ssid=Guest`
        (multiple ssid requested).
    type: str
  applicationName:
    description:
      - >
        ApplicationName query parameter. Name of the application for which the experience
        data is intended. Examples
        `applicationName=webex` (single applicationName requested) `applicationName=webex&applicationName=teams`
        (multiple applicationName requested).
    type: str
  businessRelevance:
    description:
      - >
        BusinessRelevance query parameter. The application can be chosen to be categorized
        as business-relevant,
        irrelevant, or default (neutral). By doing so, the assurance application prioritizes
        the monitoring and
        analysis of business-relevant data, ensuring critical insights are captured.
        Applications marked as
        irrelevant or default are selectively excluded from certain data sets, streamlining
        focus on what's most
        important for business outcomes.
    type: str
  attribute:
    description:
      - >
        Attribute query parameter. List of attributes related to resource that can
        be requested to only be part of
        the response along with the required attributes. Supported attributes are
        applicationName, siteId,
        exporterIpAddress, exporterNetworkDeviceId, healthScore, businessRelevance,
        usage, throughput,
        packetLossPercent, networkLatency, applicationServerLatency, clientNetworkLatency,
        serverNetworkLatency,
        trafficClass, jitter, ssid Examples `attribute=healthScore` (single attribute
        requested)
        `attribute=healthScore&attribute=ssid&attribute=jitter` (multiple attribute
        requested).
