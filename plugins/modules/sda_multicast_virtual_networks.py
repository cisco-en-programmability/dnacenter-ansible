          from 225.0.0.0/8 to 239.0.0.0/8. SSM ranges should not conflict with ranges
          provided for ASM multicast.

          ipv4Address:
            description: IPv4 address of the RP. For external RP configuration, exactly
              one of ipv4Address or ipv6Address must be provided. For fabric RP, this
              address is allocated by SDA and should not be provided during RP creation
              request and SDA allocated address should be retained in subsequent requests.
            type: str
          ipv4AsmRanges:
            description: IPv4 Any Source Multicast ranges. Comma seperated list of IPv4
              multicast group ranges that will be served by a given Multicast RP. Only
              IPv4 ranges can be provided. For fabric RP, both IPv4 and IPv6 ranges
              can be provided together. For external RP, IPv4 ranges should be provided
              for IPv4 external RP and IPv6 ranges should be provided for IPv6 external
              RP.

          ipv6Address:
            description: IPv6 address of the RP. For external RP configuration, exactly
              one of ipv4Address or ipv6Address must be provided. For fabric RP, this
              address is allocated by SDA and should not be provided during RP creation
              request and SDA allocated address should be retained in subsequent requests.
              Ipv6Address can only be provided for virtual networks with dual stack
              (IPv4 + IPv6) multicast pool.

          ipv6AsmRanges:
            description: IPv6 Any Source Multicast ranges. Comma seperated list of IPv6
              multicast group ranges that will be served by a given Multicast RP. Only
              IPv6 ranges can be provided. IPv6 ranges can only be provided for dual
              stack multicast pool. For fabric RP, both IPv4 and IPv6 ranges can be
              provided together. For external RP, IPv4 ranges should be provided for
              IPv4 external RP and IPv6 ranges should be provided for IPv6 external
              RP.

          networkDeviceIds:
            description: IDs of the network devices. This is a required field for fabric
              RPs. There can be maximum of two fabric RPs for a fabric site and these
              are shared across all multicast virtual networks. For configuring two
              fabric RPs in a fabric site both devices must have border roles. Only
              one RP can be configured in scenarios where a fabric edge device is used
              as RP or a dual stack multicast pool is used.
