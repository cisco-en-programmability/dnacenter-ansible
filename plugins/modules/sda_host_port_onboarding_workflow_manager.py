                  providing security and traffic segmentation capabilities.
                - This parameter is applicable only when the connected_device_type is set to "TRUNKING_DEVICE".
                - Accepts string containing comma-separated VLAN IDs, ranges, or 'all'.
                - VLAN IDs must be between 1 and 4094 per IEEE 802.1Q specification.
                - Ranges use hyphen notation (e.g., "100-200" includes VLANs 100-200).
                - The keyword 'all' permits all VLANs 1-4094 on the trunk link.
                - Restricting VLAN ranges improves security by limiting VLAN scope.
                - Examples
                    - "100,200,300-400" - Specific VLANs and range
                    - "1-100,200-300" - Multiple ranges
                    - "all" - All VLANs (default, use with caution in production)
                    - "10,20,30-40,100-200" - Mixed individual and range specifications
                - Native VLAN should NOT be included in allowed ranges
                  to prevent VLAN hopping attacks. Native VLAN handles untagged traffic
                  separately from tagged VLAN ranges.

          native_vlan_id:
            description:
              - Specifies the Native VLAN ID for the
                trunk port channel.
              - Native VLAN carries untagged traffic on trunk links between
                switches, access points, and other network devices.
              - This parameter is applicable only when
                the connected_device_type is set to
                "TRUNK".
              - Must be an integer between 1 and 4094, adhering to IEEE 802.1Q
                standard VLAN ID ranges.
              - If not set when connected_device_type
                is "TRUNK", the default value will be 1.
              - The native VLAN should match on both sides of the trunk link
                to prevent VLAN hopping security vulnerabilities.

          allowed_vlan_ranges:
            description:
              - Specifies the allowed VLAN ranges for trunk port traffic filtering.
              - Controls which VLANs are permitted to traverse the trunk link,
                providing security and traffic segmentation capabilities.
              - This parameter is applicable only when the connected_device_type is set to "TRUNK".
              - Accepts string containing comma-separated VLAN IDs, ranges, or 'all'.
              - VLAN IDs must be between 1 and 4094 per IEEE 802.1Q specification.
              - Ranges use hyphen notation (e.g., "100-200" includes VLANs 100-200).
              - The keyword 'all' permits all VLANs 1-4094 on the trunk link.
              - Restricting VLAN ranges improves security by limiting VLAN scope.
              - Examples
                  - "100,200,300-400" - Specific VLANs and range
                  - "1-100,200-300" - Multiple ranges
                  - "all" - All VLANs (default, use with caution in production)
                  - "10,20,30-40,100-200" - Mixed individual and range specifications
              - Native VLAN should NOT be included in allowed ranges
                to prevent VLAN hopping attacks. Native VLAN handles untagged traffic
                separately from tagged VLAN ranges.

  - Newly introduced parameters native_vlan_id and allowed_vlan_ranges in the
    port_assignments and port_channels suboptions provide enhanced VLAN
    configuration control for trunk ports connected to trunking devices.
  - These VLAN configuration parameters (native_vlan_id and allowed_vlan_ranges)
    are supported starting from Cisco Catalyst Center version 3.1.3.0 onwards.
  - The native_vlan_id parameter enables native VLAN specification for trunk
    ports, while allowed_vlan_ranges provides granular control over which VLANs
    are permitted on trunk links for improved network security and segmentation.
  - When connected_device_type is set to "TRUNKING_DEVICE", these parameters
    enable advanced trunk port configuration with security-focused VLAN filtering.
  - Native VLAN should NOT be included in allowed ranges
    to prevent VLAN hopping attacks. Native VLAN handles untagged traffic
    separately from tagged VLAN ranges.
