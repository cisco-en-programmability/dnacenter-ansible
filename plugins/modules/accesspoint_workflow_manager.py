short_description: Manage Cisco Catalyst Center access points
description:
  - Manage access point configurations in Cisco Catalyst Center.
  - Configure individual AP settings including radio interfaces, controller assignments, and location parameters.
  - Perform bulk configuration updates across multiple access points of the same series.
  - Execute lifecycle operations including AP reboot and factory reset for up to 100 devices.
  - Provision access points to sites and assign RF profiles (HIGH, LOW, TYPICAL, or custom).
  - Support advanced radio configurations for 2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz, XOR, and TRI radio interfaces.
  - Compare current configurations with desired state to apply only necessary changes.
  - Identify access points using MAC address, hostname, or management IP address.

          all client traffic to the controller. Radio parameters (For example, C(2.4ghz_radio),
          C(5ghz_radio)) can only be modified when the AP is in this mode.
          - C(Monitor): The AP does not serve clients but actively monitors the RF environment
          for rogue devices, interference, and supports features like Radio Resource Management (RRM)
          and Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
          - C(Sniffer): The AP is dedicated to capturing all 802.11 packets on a specific channel
          and forwarding them to a remote machine for analysis with tools like Wireshark.
          - C(Bridge): The AP acts as a dedicated point-to-point or point-to-multipoint bridge to
          connect different network segments wirelessly. Clients cannot connect to the AP in this mode.
