              (Broadcast, Unknown unicast, and Multicast) from
              wireless clients is handled within the fabric network.
              When enabled, BUM traffic from wireless clients is
              flooded across the fabric to ensure proper connectivity
              and service discovery. When disabled, BUM traffic
              flooding is suppressed, which can improve network
              efficiency but may impact certain network services
              that rely on broadcast or multicast communication.
              If there is an associated layer 3 virtual network,
              wireless flooding will default to false and can only
              be set to true when fabric-enabled wireless is also
              enabled. If there is no associated layer 3 virtual
              network, wireless flooding will match the

              that enables or disables Resource Guard functionality.
              Resource Guard is a security mechanism that provides
              protection against unauthorized access to network resources
              by implementing additional security controls and access
              restrictions at the VLAN level within the fabric network.
              When enabled, it enhances the security posture of the
              fabric VLAN by enforcing stricter access policies and
              monitoring capabilities.

          flooding_address_assignment:
            description: Controls the source configuration for flooding
              addresses used in layer 2 flooding within the fabric VLAN.
              This parameter determines whether the layer 2 virtual network
              uses a 'SHARED' flooding address from the parent fabric or a
              'CUSTOM' address specific to this virtual network. Two
              options are available - "SHARED" means that the layer 2
              virtual network will inherit the flooding address from
              the parent fabric configuration, ensuring consistency
              across the fabric. "CUSTOM" allows the layer 2 virtual
              network to use a different flooding address for specific
              use cases or network segmentation requirements. When set
              to "CUSTOM", you must also provide a valid flooding_address
              parameter.
            type: str
            choices: ["SHARED", "CUSTOM"]
            default: "SHARED"
          flooding_address:
            description: Specifies a custom multicast IP address for layer 2
              flooding operations within the fabric VLAN. This parameter defines
              the multicast address used when the fabric needs to flood traffic
              to all ports in the VLAN for unknown unicast, broadcast, or
              multicast frames. The IP address must be in the 239.0.0.0/8
              multicast range (239.0.0.1 through 239.255.255.255) to ensure
              proper multicast behavior and compliance with RFC standards.
              This property is applicable only when the flooding_address_assignment
              is set to "CUSTOM". If flooding_address_assignment is "SHARED",
              this parameter will be ignored as the flooding address is inherited
              from the parent fabric configuration. The address should be unique
              within your network topology to avoid multicast conflicts and
              ensure proper traffic isolation between different VLANs or fabric
              segments.

          flooding_address:
            description: Specifies a custom multicast IP address for layer 2
              flooding operations within the anycast gateway. This parameter defines
              the multicast address used when the fabric needs to flood traffic
              to all ports in the VLAN for unknown unicast, broadcast, or
              multicast frames. The IP address must be in the 239.0.0.0/8
              multicast range (239.0.0.1 through 239.255.255.255) to ensure
              proper multicast behavior and compliance with RFC standards.
              This property is applicable only when the flooding_address_assignment
              is set to "CUSTOM". If flooding_address_assignment is "SHARED",
              this parameter will be ignored as the flooding address is inherited
              from the parent fabric configuration. The address should be unique
              within your network topology to avoid multicast conflicts and
              ensure proper traffic isolation between different VLANs or fabric
              segments. This field is not applicable to INFRA_VN.

          wireless_flooding_enable:
            description: Controls wireless flooding behavior for
              the anycast gateway, which determines how BUM traffic
              (Broadcast, Unknown unicast, and Multicast) from
              wireless clients is handled within the fabric network.
              When enabled, BUM traffic from wireless clients is
              flooded across the fabric to ensure proper connectivity
              and service discovery. When disabled, BUM traffic
              flooding is suppressed, which can improve network
              efficiency but may impact certain network services
              that rely on broadcast or multicast communication.
              If there is an associated layer 3 virtual network,
              wireless flooding will default to false and can only
              be set to true when fabric-enabled wireless is also
              enabled. If there is no associated layer 3 virtual
              network, wireless flooding will match the
              fabric-enabled wireless setting.

            description: A security feature control for anycast gateways
              that enables or disables Resource Guard functionality.
              Resource Guard is a security mechanism that provides
              protection against unauthorized access to network resources
              by implementing additional security controls and access
              restrictions at the VLAN level within the fabric network.
              When enabled, it enhances the security posture of the
              anycast gateway by enforcing stricter access policies and
              monitoring capabilities.

            type: bool
requirements:
  - dnacentersdk >= 2.9.2
  - python >= 3.9
notes:
  - To ensure the module operates correctly for scaled
    sets,
    which involve creating,
    updating,
    or deleting
    Layer2 fabric VLANs and Layer3 virtual networks,
    as well as configuring anycast gateways,
    valid input
    in the playbook is required. If any failures are
    encountered,
    the module will halt execution without
    proceeding to further operations.
  - To delete the Fabric VLAN on the fabric site,
    if
    any fabric zones exist within that site,
    the Fabric
    VLAN must be deleted from the fabric zones first.
    Only after all Fabric VLANs are deleted from the
    fabric zones will the parent fabric site with VLAN
    be available for deletion.
  - For Layer 3 virtual networks,
    all Anycast Gateways
    associated with the given virtual network must be
    deleted first before the deletion operation for
    the virtual network is enabled.
  - All newly created Layer3 Virtual Networks must either
    be assigned to one or more Fabric Sites,
    or they
    all must not be assigned to any Fabric Sites.
  - To create or update a fabric VLAN according to the
    module design,
    the vlan_id parameter must be provided
    as a required input. Although in the GUI it's an
    optional parameter but to uniquely identify the
    VLAN,
    vlan is required along with the fabric site
    location.
  - If the playbook specifies fabric sites while deleting
    a virtual network,
    the module will operate at a
    lower level by removing only the fabric sites from
    the virtual network without deleting the virtual
    network itself. However,
    if only the virtual network
    name is provided,
    the module will first remove all
    associated fabric sites before proceeding with the
    deletion of the virtual network.
  - SDK Method used are
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.get_site
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.get_fabric_sites ccc_virtual_network.sda.get_fabric_zones
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.get_layer2_virtual_networks
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.add_layer2_virtual_networks
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.update_layer2_virtual_networks
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.delete_layer2_virtual_network_by_id
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.get_layer3_virtual_networks
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.add_layer3_virtual_networks
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.update_layer3_virtual_networks
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.delete_layer3_virtual_network_by_id
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.get_reserve_ip_subpool ccc_virtual_network.sda.get_anycast_gateways
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.add_anycast_gateways ccc_virtual_network.sda.update_anycast_gateways
    ccc_virtual_network.sda.delete_anycast_gateway_by_id
  - New parameters added in the module are
    wireless_flooding_enable, resource_guard_enable,
    flooding_address_assignment, flooding_address
    as part of fabric_vlan and anycast_gateways creation/updation
    will start supporting from Catalsyt Center
    with version 3.1.3.0 onwards.

            anycast_gateways (list): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains details of an

        Description:
            This function processes a list of anycast gateways to be deleted from the Cisco Catalyst Center. For each
            anycast gateway specified in `anycast_gateways`, the function performs the following steps:
            - Extracts the `vn_name`, `ip_pool_name`, and `site_name` from each dictionary.
            - Checks for the existence of the site and retrieves its ID using `get_site_id`.
            - Determines the fabric ID based on the `fabric_type` (either fabric site or fabric zone).
            - Retrieves the existing anycast gateway details from the Cisco Catalyst Center.
            - If the anycast gateway is not found, it logs an informational message and adds the unique identifier to the
            list of absent anycast gateways.
            - Finally, after processing all gateways, it logs a success message if any gateways were successfully deleted.

            This function effectively manages the deletion of anycast gateways and maintains logs for both successful
            deletions and any gateways that could not be found, ensuring clarity and traceability of actions taken within
            the Cisco Catalyst Center.
