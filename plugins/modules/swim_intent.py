- API to fetch a software image from remote file system using URL for HTTP/FTP and upload it to Catalyst Center.
  Supported image files extensions are bin, img, tar, smu, pie, aes, iso, ova, tar_gz and qcow2.
- API to fetch a software image from local file system and upload it to Catalyst Center
  Supported image files extensions are bin, img, tar, smu, pie, aes, iso, ova, tar_gz and qcow2.
- API to tag/untag image as golen for a given family of devices
- API to distribute a software image on a given device. Software image must be imported successfully into
  Catalyst Center before it can be distributed.
- API to activate a software image on a given device. Software image must be present in the device flash.

            description: It specifies the mode of upgrade to be applied to the devices having the following values - 'install', 'bundle', and 'currentlyExists'.
              install - This mode instructs Cisco Catalyst Center to perform a clean installation of the new image on the target devices.
                When this mode is selected, the existing image on the device is completely replaced with the new image during the upgrade process.
                This ensures that the device runs only the new image version after the upgrade is completed.
              bundle - This mode instructs Cisco Catalyst Center bundles the new image with the existing image on the device before initiating
                the upgrade process. This mode allows for a more efficient upgrade process by preserving the existing image on the device while
                adding the new image as an additional bundle. After the upgrade, the device can run either the existing image or the new bundled
                image, depending on the configuration.
              currentlyExists - This mode instructs Cisco Catalyst Center to checks if the target devices already have the desired image version
                installed. If image already present on devices, no action is taken and upgrade process is skipped for those devices. This mode
                is useful for avoiding unnecessary upgrades on devices that already have the correct image version installed, thereby saving time.
