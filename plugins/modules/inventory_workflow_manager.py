      # SNMP Configuration Parameters
      snmp_version:
        description:
          - It is a standard protocol used for managing and monitoring network
            devices.
          - C(v2) - In this communication between the SNMP manager (such as Cisco
            Catalyst) and the managed devices (such as routers, switches, or
            access points) is based on community strings. Community strings serve
            as a form of authentication and they are transmitted in clear text,
            providing no encryption.
          - C(v3) - It is the most secure version of SNMP, providing
            authentication, integrity, and encryption features. It allows for the
            use of usernames, authentication passwords, and encryption keys,
            providing stronger security compared to v2.
        type: str
        choices: ["v2", "v3"]
      snmp_mode:
        description:
          - Device's snmp Mode refer to different SNMP (Simple Network
            Management Protocol) versions and their corresponding security levels.
          - C(NOAUTHNOPRIV) - This mode provides no authentication or encryption
            for SNMP messages. It means that devices communicating using SNMPv1
            do not require any authentication (username/password) or encryption
            (data confidentiality). This makes it the least secure option.
          - C(AUTHNOPRIV) - This mode provides authentication but no encryption
            for SNMP messages. Authentication involves validating the source of
            the SNMP messages using a community string (similar to a password).
            However, the data transmitted between devices is not encrypted, so
            it's susceptible to eavesdropping.
          - C(AUTHPRIV) - This mode provides both authentication and encryption
            for SNMP messages. It offers the highest level of security among the
            three options. Authentication ensures that the source of the messages
            is genuine, and encryption ensures that the data exchanged between
            devices is confidential and cannot be intercepted by unauthorized
            parties.

notes:
  # Version Compatibility
  - Minimum Catalyst Center version 2.3.5.3 required for inventory workflow features.
  - Device maintenance scheduling requires Catalyst Center >= 2.3.7.9.
  - Enhanced provisioning features available in Catalyst Center >= 2.3.5.3.

  # API Methods and Endpoints
  - Primary SDK Methods - devices.Devices.add_device, devices.Devices.delete_device_by_id, devices.Devices.sync_devices.
  - REST Endpoints - POST /dna/intent/api/v1/network-device, DELETE /dna/intent/api/v1/network-device/{id}, PUT /dna/intent/api/v1/network-device.

  # Parameter Changes and Deprecations
  - Parameter 'ip_address' renamed to 'ip_address_list' in v6.12.0.
  - Removed 'managementIpAddress' options in v4.3.0.
  - Removed parameters in v6.12.0 'serial_number', 'device_added', 'role_source'.
  - Added in v6.13.1 - 'add_user_defined_field', 'update_interface_details', 'export_device_list', 'admin_status'.
  - Removed in v6.13.1 - 'provision_wireless_device', 'reprovision_wired_device', 'device_updated'.

  # Security and Best Practices
  - Use strong passwords for device access and file encryption (8+ characters,
    mixed case, numbers, symbols).
  - Enable SNMP v3 with AUTHPRIV mode for secure device monitoring.
  - Regularly rotate device credentials and update in Catalyst Center.
  - Use HTTPS (http_secure=true) for web-based device management.

  # Performance and Limitations
  - Maximum 200 devices per resync operation to prevent API timeouts.
  - Export operations limited to 800 devices per API call.
  - Maintenance scheduling supports up to 365-day recurrence intervals.
  - Use appropriate batch sizes for large-scale operations.

  # Device Type Specific Requirements
  - NETWORK_DEVICE - Requires username, password, and transport protocol.
  - COMPUTE_DEVICE - Requires http_username, http_password, and http_port.
  - MERAKI_DASHBOARD -  Requires only http_password (API key).
  - FIREPOWER_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM - Requires http_username, http_password, http_port.
  - THIRD_PARTY_DEVICE - Requires SNMP configuration for monitoring.

  # Operational Considerations
  - Device deletion with clean_config=false retains device configuration. To delete a
    device along with its configuration, the 'clean_config' flag must be explicitly
    set to True.
  - Interface updates only supported on user-facing/access ports.
  - MAC address table clearing restricted to ACCESS role devices.
  - Timezone specification recommended for maintenance scheduling accuracy. For a list
    of supported time zones, please refer to the relevant documentation detailing all
    available options.
  - Verify device reachability before bulk operations.

  # Error Handling and Troubleshooting
  - Monitor task status for long-running operations.
  - Check device management state before provisioning.
