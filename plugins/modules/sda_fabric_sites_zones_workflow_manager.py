    description: A list containing detailed configurations
      for creating, updating, or deleting fabric sites
      or zones in a Software-Defined Access (SDA) environment.
      It also includes specifications for updating the
      authentication profile template for these sites.
      Each element in the list represents a specific
      operation to be performed on the SDA infrastructure,
      such as the addition, modification, or removal
      of fabric sites/zones, and modifications to authentication
      profiles.

        description: A dictionary containing detailed
          configurations for managing REST Endpoints
          that will receive Audit log and Events from
          the Cisco Catalyst Center Platform. This dictionary
          is essential for specifying attributes and
          parameters required for the lifecycle management
          of fabric sites, zones, and associated authentication
          profiles.
        type: dict
        suboptions:
          site_name_hierarchy:
            description: This name uniquely identifies
              the site for operations such as creating,
              updating, or deleting fabric sites or
              zones, as well as for updating the authentication
              profile template. This parameter is mandatory
              for any fabric site/zone management operation.

              The acceptable values are 'fabric_site'
              and 'fabric_zone'. The default value is
              'fabric_site', indicating the configuration
              of a broader network area, whereas 'fabric_zone'
              typically refers to a more specific segment
              within the site.

          authentication_profile:
            description: The authentication profile
              applied to the specified fabric. This
              profile determines the security posture
              and controls for network access within
              the site. Possible values include 'Closed
              Authentication', 'Low Impact', 'No Authentication',
              and 'Open Authentication'. This setting
              is critical when creating or updating
              a fabric site or updating the authentication
              profile template.
            type: str
          is_pub_sub_enabled:
            description: A boolean flag that indicates
              whether the pub/sub mechanism is enabled
              for control nodes in the fabric site.
              This feature is relevant only when creating
              or updating fabric sites, not fabric zones.
              When set to 'true', pub/sub is enabled for
              more efficient control plane communication
              within the fabric site. The default is True
              for fabric sites, and this setting is not
              applicable for fabric zones.
              When set to 'false', the fabric site is
              configured to use LISP/BGP for control plane
              communication, which provides traditional
              routing mechanisms.
            type: bool
            default: true
          apply_pending_events:
            description: Modifying an IP address pool
              used in a fabric causes the fabric to
              become outdated. An update is required
              to apply the IP address pool changes to
              the devices in the fabric site. The reconfiguration
              time depends on the number of devices.
              During an upgrade, any pending fabric
              updates are captured as pending fabric
              events and applied to the respective site.  By
              default, this is set to False.
            type: bool
          update_authentication_profile:
            description: A dictionary containing the
              specific details required to update the
              authentication profile template associated
              with the fabric site. This includes advanced
              settings that fine-tune the authentication
              process and security controls within the
              site.

                  of authentication for the site. The
                  available methods are 'dot1x' (IEEE
                  802.1X) and 'mac' (MAC-based authentication).
                  This setting determines the order
                  in which authentication mechanisms
                  are attempted.
                type: str
              dot1x_fallback_timeout:
                description: The timeout duration, in
                  seconds, for falling back from 802.1X
                  authentication. This value must be
                  within the range of 3 to 120 seconds.
                  It defines the period a device waits
                  before attempting an alternative authentication
                  method if 802.1X fails.
                type: int
              wake_on_lan:
                description: A boolean value indicating
                  whether the Wake-on-LAN feature is
                  enabled. Wake-on-LAN allows the network
                  to remotely wake up devices that are
                  in a low-power state.
                type: bool
              number_of_hosts:
                description: Specifies the number of
                  hosts allowed per port. The available
                  options are 'Single' for one device
                  per port or 'Unlimited' for multiple
                  devices. This setting helps in controlling
                  the network access and maintaining
                  security.
                type: str
              enable_bpu_guard:
                description: A boolean setting that
                  enables or disables BPDU Guard. BPDU
                  Guard provides a security mechanism
                  by disabling a port when a BPDU (Bridge
                  Protocol Data Unit) is received, protecting
                  against potential network loops. This
                  setting defaults to true and is applicable
                  only when the authentication profile
                  is set to "Closed Authentication".
                type: bool
              pre_auth_acl:
                description: Defines the Pre-Authentication
                  Access Control List (ACL), which is
                  applicable only when the 'authentication_profile'
                  is set to "Low Impact." This profile
                  allows limited network access before
                  authentication, and the ACL controls
                  which traffic is allowed or blocked
                  during this phase. It is not used
                  with other profiles, as they typically
                  block all traffic until authentication
                  is complete.

                      match any explicit ACL rules.
                      Common actions include 'PERMIT'
                      to allow unmatched traffic or
                      'DENY' to block it.  Implicit

requirements:
  - dnacentersdk >= 2.9.2
  - python >= 3.9
notes:
  - To ensure the module operates correctly for scaled
    sets,
    which involve creating or updating fabric
    sites/zones and handling the updation of authentication
    profile template,
    please provide valid input in
    the playbook. If any failure is encountered,
    the
    module will and halt execution without proceeding
    to further operations.
  - When deleting fabric sites,
    make sure to provide
    the input to remove the fabric zones associated
    with them in the playbook. Fabric sites cannot be
    deleted until all underlying fabric zones have been
    removed and it can be any order as per the module
    design fabric zones will be deleted first followed
    by fabric sites.
  - Reconfiguration of fabric pending events is supported
    starting from version 2.3.7.9 onwards. Additionally,
    the authentication profile for the 'Low Impact'
    profile now allows more customization of its parameters
  - Parameter 'site_name' is updated to 'site_name_hierarchy'.

            This method processes the provided configuration to manage fabric sites and zones in Cisco Catalyst Center.
            1. Fabric Sites
                - If 'fabric_sites' is present in the configuration, it iterates over the list of sites.
                - Checks if the site needs to be created or updated based on its type ("fabric_site" or "fabric_zone").
                - Creates or updates the site as necessary. If the site does not need any updates, it logs this information.
            2. Authentication Profile
                - If an `update_authentication_profile` parameter is provided, it validates and updates the authentication
                    profile template associated with the site.
                - Ensures that the authentication profile is valid and performs updates if needed.
                - If no update is necessary or if the profile is not present, it logs the appropriate messages.
