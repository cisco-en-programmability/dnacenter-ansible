short_description: Resource module for Icap Settings Deploy Id Delete Deploy V1
description:
- Manage operation create of the resource Icap Settings Deploy Id Delete Deploy V1.
- >
   Remove the ICAP configuration from the device by *id* without preview-deploy. The path parameter *id* can be
   retrieved from the **GET /dna/intent/api/v1/icapSettings** API. The response body contains a task object with a
   taskId and a URL. Use the URL to check the task status. ICAP FULL, ONBOARDING, OTA, and SPECTRUM configurations
   have a durationInMins field. A disable task is scheduled to remove the configuration from the device. Removing the
   ICAP intent should be done after the pre-scheduled disable task has been deployed. For detailed information about
   the usage of the API, please refer to the Open API specification document - https //github.com/cisco-en-
   programmability/catalyst-center-api-specs/blob/main/Assurance/CE_Cat_Center_Org-ICAP_APIs-1.0.0-resolved.yaml.
