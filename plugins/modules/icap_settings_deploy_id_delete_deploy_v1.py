module: icap_settings_deploy_id_delete_deploy_v1
short_description: Resource module for Icap Settings Deploy Id Delete Deploy V1
description:
  - Manage operation create of the resource Icap Settings Deploy Id Delete Deploy
    V1.
  - >
    Remove the ICAP configuration from the device by *id* without preview-deploy.
    The path parameter *id* can be
    retrieved from the **GET /dna/intent/api/v1/icapSettings** API. The response body
    contains a task object with a
    taskId and a URL. Use the URL to check the task status. ICAP FULL, ONBOARDING,
    OTA, and SPECTRUM configurations
    have a durationInMins field. A disable task is scheduled to remove the configuration
    from the device. Removing the
    ICAP intent should be done after the pre-scheduled disable task has been deployed.
    For detailed information about
    the usage of the API, please refer to the Open API specification document - https
    //github.com/cisco-en-
    programmability/catalyst-center-api-specs/blob/main/Assurance/CE_Cat_Center_Org-ICAP_APIs-1.0.0-resolved.yaml.
