    type: dict
  startTime:
    description:
      - >
        StartTime query parameter. Start time from which API queries the data set
        related to the resource. It must
        be specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
    type: float
  endTime:
    description:
      - >
        EndTime query parameter. End time to which API queries the data set related
        to the resource. It must be
        specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
    type: float
  siteId:
    description:
      - >
        SiteId query parameter. The site UUID without the top level hierarchy. `siteId`
        is mandatory. `siteId` must
        be a site UUID of a building. (Ex."buildingUuid") Examples `siteId=buildingUuid`
        (single siteId requested)
        `siteId=buildingUuid1&siteId=buildingUuid2` (multiple siteId requested).
    type: str
  ssid:
    description:
      - >
        Ssid query parameter. In the context of a network application, SSID refers
        to the name of the wireless
        network to which the client connects. Examples `ssid=Alpha` (single ssid requested)
        `ssid=Alpha&ssid=Guest`
        (multiple ssid requested).
    type: str
  applicationName:
    description:
      - >
        ApplicationName query parameter. Name of the application for which the experience
        data is intended. Examples
        `applicationName=webex` (single applicationName requested) `applicationName=webex&applicationName=teams`
        (multiple applicationName requested).
    type: str
  businessRelevance:
    description:
      - >
        BusinessRelevance query parameter. The application can be chosen to be categorized
        as business-relevant,
        irrelevant, or default (neutral). By doing so, the assurance application prioritizes
        the monitoring and
        analysis of business-relevant data, ensuring critical insights are captured.
        Applications marked as
        irrelevant or default are selectively excluded from certain data sets, streamlining
        focus on what's most
        important for business outcomes.
