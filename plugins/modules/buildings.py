options:
  address:
    description: Building address. Example 4900 Marie P. Debartolo Way, Santa Clara,
      California 95054, United States. Please note that if only the address is provided
      when creating a building, the UI will not display the geo-location on the map.
      To ensure the location is rendered, you must also provide the latitude and longitude.
      If a building has been created without these coordinates and you wish to display
      its geo-location on the map later, you can edit the building details via the
      UI to include the latitude and longitude. This limitation will be resolved in
      a future release.
