description:
  - Get all System Issue Definitions Count V1.
  - >
    Get the count of system defined issue definitions based on provided filters. Supported
    filters are id, name,
    profileId and definition enable status. For detailed information about the usage
    of the API, please refer to the
    Open API specification document - https //github.com/cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-api-
    specs/blob/main/Assurance/CE_Cat_Center_Org-issueAndHealthDefinitions-1.0.0-resolved.yaml.

    type: dict
  deviceType:
    description:
      - >
        DeviceType query parameter. These are the device families/types supported
        for system issue definitions. If
        no input is made on device type, all device types are considered.
    type: str
  profileId:
    description:
      - >
        ProfileId query parameter. The profile identier to fetch the profile associated
        issue defintions. The
        default is `global`. Please refer Network design profiles documentation for
        more details.
    type: str
  id:
    description:
      - >
        Id query parameter. The definition identifier. Examples id=015d9cba-4f53-4087-8317-7e49e5ffef46
        (single
        entity id request) id=015d9cba-4f53-4087-8317-7e49e5ffef46&id=015d9cba-4f53-4087-8317-7e49e5ffef47
        (multiple
        ids in the query param).
    type: str
  name:
    description:
      - >
        Name query parameter. The list of system defined issue names. (Ex."BGP_Down")
        Examples name=BGP_Down (single
        entity uuid requested) name=BGP_Down&name=BGP_Flap (multiple issue names separated
        by & operator).
    type: str
  priority:
    description:
      - >
        Priority query parameter. Issue priority, possible values are P1, P2, P3,
        P4. `P1` A critical issue that
        needs immediate attention and can have a wide impact on network operations.
        `P2` A major issue that can
        potentially impact multiple devices or clients. `P3` A minor issue that has
        a localized or minimal impact.
        `P4` A warning issue that may not be an immediate problem but addressing it
        can optimize the network
        performance.
    type: str
  issueEnabled:
    description:
      - IssueEnabled query parameter. The enablement status of the issue definition,
        either true or false.
    type: bool
