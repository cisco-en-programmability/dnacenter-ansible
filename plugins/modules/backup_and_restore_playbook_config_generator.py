short_description: Generate YAML playbook for 'backup_and_restore_workflow_manager' module.
description:
  - Generates YAML configurations compatible with the
    backup_and_restore_workflow_manager module, reducing manual playbook
    creation effort and enabling programmatic modifications.
  - Represents NFS server configurations and backup storage configurations
    for backup and restore operations on Cisco Catalyst Center.
  - Supports extraction of NFS configurations, backup storage configurations
    with encryption and retention policies.
  - Generated YAML format is directly usable with
    backup_and_restore_workflow_manager module for infrastructure as code.

class BackupRestorePlaybookGenerator(DnacBase, BrownFieldHelper):
    """
    Class for generating brownfield YAML playbooks for backup and restore configurations
    from Cisco Catalyst Center.

    This class orchestrates the complete workflow for extracting backup and restore
    configurations from Catalyst Center and generating YAML playbook files compatible
    with the backup_and_restore_workflow_manager module. Handles NFS server configurations,
    backup storage configurations, component filtering, API data retrieval, transformation,
    and YAML file generation with comprehensive error handling and validation.

    Purpose:
        - Retrieves backup and restore configurations from Catalyst Center APIs
        - Transforms API responses to user-friendly YAML format
        - Generates playbook files for infrastructure as code workflows
        - Supports component-specific filtering (NFS and backup storage)
        - Validates parameters and handles errors gracefully
        - Provides detailed logging and operation tracking

    Inherits From:
        - DnacBase: Provides Catalyst Center SDK connectivity and base operations
        - BrownFieldHelper: Provides YAML generation and file handling utilities

    Supported Components:
        - nfs_configuration: NFS server details with paths, ports, and versions
        - backup_storage_configuration: Backup storage with encryption and retention

    Key Operations:
        - Validate input parameters against schema requirements
        - Retrieve configurations using Catalyst Center SDK methods
        - Apply component-specific filters for targeted extraction
        - Transform API responses to YAML-compatible structures
        - Generate timestamped YAML files with complete configurations
        - Track processing statistics and execution metrics

    Integration:
        - Uses backup.Backup.get_all_n_f_s_configurations API
        - Uses backup.Backup.get_backup_configuration API
        - Generates YAML compatible with backup_and_restore_workflow_manager module
        - Supports Catalyst Center version 3.1.3.0 and higher

    Workflow:
        1. Initialize with module parameters and connection details
        2. Validate input configuration and component selections
        3. Retrieve configurations from Catalyst Center for specified components
        4. Apply filters to extract specific configurations
        5. Transform API responses using specification mappings
        6. Generate YAML file with structured playbook content
        7. Return execution results with statistics and file path

    Attributes:
        supported_states (list): Valid states for module operation (['gathered'])
        module_schema (dict): Component mapping with API details and specifications
        module_name (str): Reference module name for generated playbooks
        validated_config (list): Validated input configuration parameters if successful.
        want (dict): Desired state configuration for processing
        result (dict): Execution results with status and response data

    Example Usage:
        generator = BackupRestorePlaybookGenerator(module)
        generator.validate_input().check_return_status()
        generator.get_want(config, 'gathered').check_return_status()

    Main entry point for the Cisco Catalyst Center brownfield backup and restore playbook generator module.

    This function serves as the primary execution entry point for the Ansible module,
    orchestrating the complete workflow from parameter collection to YAML playbook
    generation for brownfield backup and restore configuration extraction.

    Purpose:
        Initializes and executes the brownfield backup and restore playbook generator
        workflow to extract existing NFS configurations and backup storage settings
        from Cisco Catalyst Center and generate Ansible-compatible YAML playbook files.

    Workflow Steps:
        1. Define module argument specification with required parameters
        2. Initialize Ansible module with argument validation
        3. Create BackupRestorePlaybookGenerator instance
        4. Validate Catalyst Center version compatibility (>= 3.1.3.0)
        5. Validate and sanitize state parameter
        6. Execute input parameter validation
        7. Process each configuration item in the playbook
        8. Handle generate_all_configurations and default component logic
        9. Execute state-specific operations (gathered workflow)
        10. Return results via module.exit_json()

    Module Arguments:
        Connection Parameters:
            - dnac_host (str, required): Catalyst Center hostname/IP
            - dnac_port (str, default="443"): HTTPS port
            - dnac_username (str, default="admin"): Authentication username
            - dnac_password (str, required, no_log): Authentication password
            - dnac_verify (bool, default=True): SSL certificate verification

        API Configuration:
            - dnac_version (str, default="2.2.3.3"): Catalyst Center version
            - dnac_api_task_timeout (int, default=1200): API timeout (seconds)
            - dnac_task_poll_interval (int, default=2): Poll interval (seconds)
            - validate_response_schema (bool, default=True): Schema validation

        Logging Configuration:
            - dnac_debug (bool, default=False): Debug mode
            - dnac_log (bool, default=False): Enable file logging
            - dnac_log_level (str, default="WARNING"): Log level
            - dnac_log_file_path (str, default="dnac.log"): Log file path
            - dnac_log_append (bool, default=True): Append to log file

        Playbook Configuration:
            - config (list[dict], required): Configuration parameters list
            - state (str, default="gathered", choices=["gathered"]): Workflow state

    Version Requirements:
        - Minimum Catalyst Center version: 3.1.3.0
        - Introduced APIs for backup and restore configuration retrieval:
            * NFS Configuration (get_all_n_f_s_configurations)
            * Backup Storage Configuration (get_backup_configuration)

    Supported States:
        - gathered: Extract existing backup and restore configurations and generate YAML playbook
        - Future: merged, deleted, replaced (reserved for future use)

    Error Handling:
        - Version compatibility failures: Module exits with error
        - Invalid state parameter: Module exits with error
        - Input validation failures: Module exits with error
        - Configuration processing errors: Module exits with error
        - All errors are logged and returned via module.fail_json()

    Return Format:
        Success: module.exit_json() with result containing:
            - changed (bool): Whether changes were made
            - msg (str/dict): Operation result message or structured response
            - response (dict): Detailed operation results with statistics
            - status (str): Operation status ("success")

        Failure: module.fail_json() with error details:
            - failed (bool): True
            - msg (str): Error message
            - error (str): Detailed error information
