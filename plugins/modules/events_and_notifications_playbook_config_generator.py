short_description: Generate YAML playbook for 'events_and_notifications_workflow_manager' module.
description:
- Generates YAML configurations compatible with the
  events_and_notifications_workflow_manager module for brownfield infrastructure
  discovery and documentation.
- Retrieves existing events and notifications configurations from Cisco Catalyst
  Center including webhook destinations, email destinations, syslog destinations,
  SNMP destinations, ITSM integration settings, and event subscriptions.
- Transforms API responses to playbook-compatible YAML format with parameter
  name mapping, password redaction, and structure optimization for Ansible
  execution.
- Supports comprehensive filtering capabilities including component-specific
  filters, destination name filters, and notification subscription filters.
- Enables automated brownfield discovery by retrieving all configured
  components when generate_all_configurations is enabled.
- Resolves site IDs to hierarchical site names and event IDs to event names
  for human-readable playbook generation.
- Creates structured playbook files ready for modification and redeployment
  through events_and_notifications_workflow_manager module.

- Module performs read-only operations and does not modify Catalyst Center
  configurations.
- Generated YAML files contain password placeholders marked as
  "***REDACTED***" for security.
- Site IDs are automatically resolved to hierarchical site names for
  readability.
- Event IDs are automatically resolved to event names using Event Artifacts
  API.
- Pagination is automatically handled for large datasets in webhook, SNMP,
  and event subscriptions.
- Generated playbooks are compatible with
  events_and_notifications_workflow_manager module.
- Destination name filtering in destination_filters.destination_names is
  applied only within component types listed in components_list. Components
  not in components_list are never retrieved regardless of destination_names
  or destination_types values. If destination_names contains only names
  belonging to an unselected component type, those names are ignored.

            - Fetches email destinations with primary/secondary SMTP server settings
            - Discovers syslog destinations with server addresses, protocols, and ports
            - Collects SNMP destinations with version, community, authentication details

    Main entry point for the Cisco Catalyst Center brownfield events and notifications playbook generator module.

    This function serves as the primary execution entry point for the Ansible module,
    orchestrating the complete workflow from parameter collection to YAML playbook
    generation for brownfield events and notifications configuration extraction.

    Purpose:
        Initializes and executes the brownfield events and notifications playbook generator
        workflow to extract existing destination configurations, ITSM settings, and event
        subscriptions from Cisco Catalyst Center and generate Ansible-compatible YAML playbook files.

    Workflow Steps:
        1. Define module argument specification with required parameters
        2. Initialize Ansible module with argument validation
        3. Create EventsNotificationsPlaybookGenerator instance
        4. Validate Catalyst Center version compatibility (>= 2.3.5.3)
        5. Validate and sanitize state parameter
        6. Execute input parameter validation
        7. Process each configuration item in the playbook
        8. Handle generate_all_configurations and default component logic
        9. Execute state-specific operations (gathered workflow)
        10. Return results via module.exit_json()

    Module Arguments:
        Connection Parameters:
            - dnac_host (str, required): Catalyst Center hostname/IP
            - dnac_port (str, default="443"): HTTPS port
            - dnac_username (str, default="admin"): Authentication username
            - dnac_password (str, required, no_log): Authentication password
            - dnac_verify (bool, default=True): SSL certificate verification

        API Configuration:
            - dnac_version (str, default="2.2.3.3"): Catalyst Center version
            - dnac_api_task_timeout (int, default=1200): API timeout (seconds)
            - dnac_task_poll_interval (int, default=2): Poll interval (seconds)
            - validate_response_schema (bool, default=True): Schema validation

        Logging Configuration:
            - dnac_debug (bool, default=False): Debug mode
            - dnac_log (bool, default=False): Enable file logging
            - dnac_log_level (str, default="WARNING"): Log level
            - dnac_log_file_path (str, default="dnac.log"): Log file path
            - dnac_log_append (bool, default=True): Append to log file

        Playbook Configuration:
            - config (list[dict], required): Configuration parameters list
            - state (str, default="gathered", choices=["gathered"]): Workflow state

    Version Requirements:
        - Minimum Catalyst Center version: 2.3.5.3
        - Introduced APIs for events and notifications retrieval:
            * Webhook Destinations (get_webhook_destination)
            * Email Destinations (get_email_destination)
            * Syslog Destinations (get_syslog_destination)
            * SNMP Destinations (get_snmp_destination)
            * ITSM Settings (get_all_itsm_integration_settings)
            * Event Subscriptions (get_rest_webhook_event_subscriptions, get_email_event_subscriptions, get_syslog_event_subscriptions)

    Supported States:
        - gathered: Extract existing events and notifications configurations and generate YAML playbook
        - Future: merged, deleted, replaced (reserved for future use)

    Error Handling:
        - Version compatibility failures: Module exits with error
        - Invalid state parameter: Module exits with error
        - Input validation failures: Module exits with error
        - Configuration processing errors: Module exits with error
        - All errors are logged and returned via module.fail_json()

    Return Format:
        Success: module.exit_json() with result containing:
            - changed (bool): Whether changes were made
            - msg (str/dict): Operation result message or structured response
            - response (dict): Detailed operation results with statistics
            - status (str): Operation status ("success")

        Failure: module.fail_json() with error details:
            - failed (bool): True
            - msg (str): Error message
            - error (str): Detailed error information
