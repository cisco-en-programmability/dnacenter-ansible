short_description: Generate YAML configurations playbook for 'assurance_device_health_score_settings_workflow_manager' module.
description:
  - Generates YAML configuration playbooks compatible with the
    C(assurance_device_health_score_settings_workflow_manager) module from existing
    Cisco Catalyst Center configurations.
  - Extracts device health score settings including device family KPI thresholds,
    overall health inclusion flags, and issue threshold synchronization settings
    from Catalyst Center.
  - Reduces manual effort in creating Ansible playbooks for brownfield
    infrastructure by automatically discovering and documenting existing
    configurations.
  - Supports auto-discovery mode to extract all configured device health score
    settings across all device families.
  - Supports targeted extraction using device family filters for specific
    infrastructure components.
  - Uses multiple API calls with C(includeForOverallHealth) parameter variations
    (both true and false) to ensure complete data extraction from Catalyst Center.
  - When device families are specified in filters, executes separate API calls
    for each device family for optimal data retrieval and filtering.
  - When no device families are specified, retrieves all available device health
    score settings from the system for complete brownfield discovery.
  - Generated YAML files include comprehensive header comments with metadata,
    generation timestamp, source system details, configuration summary statistics,
    and usage instructions.
  - Supports modern nested filter structures (C(component_specific_filters)) for backward compatibility.
  - Provides detailed operation summaries including success and failure statistics,
    device family categorization (complete success, partial success, complete
    failure), and comprehensive error reporting for troubleshooting.

                - Valid device family names include C(ROUTER) for routing devices,
                  C(SWITCH_AND_HUB) for switching infrastructure,
                  C(WIRELESS_CONTROLLER) for wireless LAN controllers,

                  client devices.
                - If not specified, all device families with configured KPI
                  threshold settings will be extracted for comprehensive
                  brownfield documentation.
                - Duplicate device family values are automatically removed while
                  preserving the original order of unique entries.
                - Each device family may have different KPI metrics and
                  thresholds based on device capabilities and health monitoring
                  requirements.
                - Example filter C(["UNIFIED_AP", "ROUTER", "SWITCH_AND_HUB",
                  "WIRELESS_CONTROLLER"]) extracts settings for wireless and
                  wired infrastructure.

requirements:
- dnacentersdk >= 2.7.2
- python >= 3.9
- PyYAML >= 5.1
notes:
- SDK Method used is devices.Devices.get_all_health_score_definitions_for_given_filters
- Path used is GET /dna/intent/api/v1/device-health/health-score/definitions
- Module requires Catalyst Center version 2.3.7.9 or higher for device health
  score settings support.
- Generated YAML files include comprehensive header comments with generation
  metadata, configuration summary statistics, and usage instructions.
- The module executes multiple API calls with C(includeForOverallHealth)
  parameter variations (true and false) to ensure complete KPI data extraction.
- When device families are specified, separate API calls are made for each
  device family for optimal performance and data filtering.
- Operation summaries include detailed success/failure statistics with device
  family categorization for troubleshooting and validation.
- Supports both auto-discovery mode (C(generate_all_configurations=true)) for
  complete infrastructure extraction and targeted mode with filters for
  specific components.
- Check mode is supported but does not perform actual YAML file generation;
  it validates parameters and returns expected operation results.
- The module is idempotent; running multiple times with the same parameters
  generates identical YAML content (except generation timestamp in header).
- Generated YAML files can be used directly with
  C(assurance_device_health_score_settings_workflow_manager) module to apply
  configurations to other Catalyst Center instances.
- Device family names are case-sensitive and must match exact names used in
  Catalyst Center (e.g., C(UNIFIED_AP) not C(unified_ap)).
- KPI names in generated YAML use user-friendly format (e.g., C(CPU Utilization))
  rather than internal API format (e.g., C(cpuUtilizationThreshold)) for
  improved readability.
- The module handles connection timeouts, API errors, and invalid responses
  with comprehensive error messages and operation summaries.
- Large-scale deployments with many device families and KPIs may require
  increased C(dnac_api_task_timeout) values for complete data extraction.
- Generated YAML structure follows ordered dictionary format to maintain
  consistent key ordering across multiple generations.

class AssuranceDeviceHealthScorePlaybookGenerator(DnacBase, BrownFieldHelper):
    """
    Brownfield playbook generator for Cisco Catalyst Center device health score settings.

    This class orchestrates automated YAML playbook generation for device health score
    settings by extracting existing configurations from Cisco Catalyst Center via REST APIs
    and transforming them into Ansible playbooks compatible with the
    assurance_device_health_score_settings_workflow_manager module.

    The generator supports both auto-discovery mode (extracting all configured settings)
    and targeted extraction mode (filtering by device families and KPI settings) to
    facilitate brownfield infrastructure documentation, configuration backup, migration
    planning, and multi-site deployment standardization workflows.

    Key Capabilities:
    - Extracts device family KPI thresholds, overall health inclusion flags, and issue
      threshold synchronization settings from Catalyst Center
    - Executes multiple API calls with includeForOverallHealth parameter variations
      (both true and false) to ensure complete data extraction
    - Generates YAML files with comprehensive header comments including metadata,
      generation timestamp, configuration summary statistics, and usage instructions
    - Provides detailed operation summaries with success/failure statistics, device
      family categorization (complete success, partial success, complete failure),
      and comprehensive error reporting for troubleshooting
    - Supports legacy filter formats (global_filters) and modern nested filter
      structures (component_specific_filters) for backward compatibility
    - Transforms internal API KPI names to user-friendly format for improved
      playbook readability and maintainability

    Inheritance:
        DnacBase: Provides Cisco Catalyst Center API connectivity, authentication,
                  request execution, logging infrastructure, and common utility methods
        BrownFieldHelper: Provides parameter transformation utilities, reverse mapping
                         functions, and configuration processing helpers for brownfield
                         operations

    Class-Level Attributes:
        supported_states (list): List of supported Ansible states, currently ['gathered']
                                for configuration extraction workflow
        module_schema (dict): Network elements schema configuration mapping API families,
                             functions, filters, and reverse mapping specifications
        module_name (str): Target workflow manager module name for generated playbooks
                          ('assurance_device_health_score_settings_workflow_manager')
        operation_successes (list): Tracking list for successful KPI configuration
                                   retrievals with device family and threshold details
        operation_failures (list): Tracking list for failed operations with error
                                  information, error codes, and failure context
        total_device_families_processed (int): Counter for unique device families
                                              processed during retrieval operations
        total_kpis_processed (int): Counter for total KPI configurations processed
                                   across all device families
        generate_all_configurations (bool): Flag indicating auto-discovery mode enabling
                                           complete infrastructure extraction

    Workflow Execution:
        1. validate_input() - Validates playbook configuration parameters and filters
        2. get_want() - Constructs desired state parameters from validated configuration
        3. get_diff_gathered() - Orchestrates YAML generation workflow execution
        4. yaml_config_generator() - Generates YAML file with header and configurations
        5. get_device_health_score_settings() - Retrieves settings via API calls
        6. apply_health_score_filters() - Applies component-specific filtering
        7. write_dict_to_yaml() - Writes formatted YAML with header comments to file

    Notes:
        - The class is idempotent; multiple runs with same parameters generate identical
          YAML content (except generation timestamp in header comments)
        - Check mode is supported but does not perform actual file generation; validates
          parameters and returns expected operation results
        - Large-scale deployments with many device families may require increased
          dnac_api_task_timeout values for complete data extraction
        - Generated YAML files use OrderedDumper for consistent key ordering across
          multiple generations
        - Device family names are case-sensitive and must match exact names used in
          Catalyst Center (e.g., 'UNIFIED_AP' not 'unified_ap')

    Main entry point for the Cisco Catalyst Center brownfield device health score settings playbook generator module.

    This function serves as the primary execution entry point for the Ansible module,
    orchestrating the complete workflow from parameter collection to YAML playbook
    generation for brownfield device health score settings extraction.

    Purpose:
        Initializes and executes the brownfield device health score settings playbook generator
        workflow to extract existing device health score configurations from Cisco Catalyst Center
        and generate Ansible-compatible YAML playbook files.

    Workflow Steps:
        1. Define module argument specification with required parameters
        2. Initialize Ansible module with argument validation
        3. Create AssuranceDeviceHealthScorePlaybookGenerator instance
        4. Validate Catalyst Center version compatibility (>= 2.3.7.9)
        5. Validate and sanitize state parameter
        6. Execute input parameter validation
        7. Process each configuration item in the playbook
        8. Execute state-specific operations (gathered workflow)
        9. Return results via module.exit_json()

    Module Arguments:
        Connection Parameters:
            - dnac_host (str, required): Catalyst Center hostname/IP

            - dnac_task_poll_interval (int, default=2): Poll interval (seconds)
            - validate_response_schema (bool, default=True): Schema validation

        Logging Configuration:
            - dnac_debug (bool, default=False): Debug mode
            - dnac_log (bool, default=False): Enable file logging
            - dnac_log_level (str, default="WARNING"): Log level
            - dnac_log_file_path (str, default="dnac.log"): Log file path
            - dnac_log_append (bool, default=True): Append to log file

        Playbook Configuration:
            - config (list[dict], required): Configuration parameters list
            - state (str, default="gathered", choices=["gathered"]): Workflow state

    Version Requirements:
        - Minimum Catalyst Center version: 2.3.7.9
        - Introduced APIs for device health score settings retrieval:
            * get_all_health_score_definitions_for_given_filters

    Supported States:
        - gathered: Extract existing device health score settings and generate YAML playbook
        - Future: merged, deleted, replaced (reserved for future use)

    Error Handling:
        - Version compatibility failures: Module exits with error
        - Invalid state parameter: Module exits with error
        - Input validation failures: Module exits with error
        - Configuration processing errors: Module exits with error
        - All errors are logged and returned via module.fail_json()

    Return Format:
        Success: module.exit_json() with result containing:
            - changed (bool): Whether changes were made
            - msg (str): Operation result message
            - response (dict): Detailed operation results
            - operation_summary (dict): Execution statistics

        Failure: module.fail_json() with error details:
