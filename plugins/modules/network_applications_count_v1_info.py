description:
- Get all Network Applications Count V1.
- >
   Retrieves the number of network applications by applying basic filtering. If startTime and endTime are not
   provided, the API defaults to the last 24 hours. `siteId` is mandatory. `siteId` must be a site UUID of a
   building. For detailed information about the usage of the API, please refer to the Open API specification document
   - https //github.com/cisco-en-programmability/catalyst-center-api-specs/blob/main/Assurance/CE_Cat_Center_Org-
   NetworkApplications-1.0.0-resolved.yaml.

    type: dict
  startTime:
    description:
    - >
      StartTime query parameter. Start time from which API queries the data set related to the resource. It must
      be specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
    type: float
  endTime:
    description:
    - >
      EndTime query parameter. End time to which API queries the data set related to the resource. It must be
      specified in UNIX epochtime in milliseconds. Value is inclusive.
    type: float
  siteId:
    description:
    - >
      SiteId query parameter. The site UUID without the top level hierarchy. `siteId` is mandatory. `siteId` must
      be a site UUID of a building. (Ex."buildingUuid") Examples `siteId=buildingUuid` (single siteId requested)
      `siteId=buildingUuid1&siteId=buildingUuid2` (multiple siteId requested).
    type: str
  ssid:
    description:
    - >
      Ssid query parameter. In the context of a network application, SSID refers to the name of the wireless
      network to which the client connects. Examples `ssid=Alpha` (single ssid requested) `ssid=Alpha&ssid=Guest`
      (multiple ssid requested).
    type: str
  applicationName:
    description:
    - >
      ApplicationName query parameter. Name of the application for which the experience data is intended. Examples
      `applicationName=webex` (single applicationName requested) `applicationName=webex&applicationName=teams`
      (multiple applicationName requested).
    type: str
  businessRelevance:
    description:
    - >
      BusinessRelevance query parameter. The application can be chosen to be categorized as business-relevant,
      irrelevant, or default (neutral). By doing so, the assurance application prioritizes the monitoring and
      analysis of business-relevant data, ensuring critical insights are captured. Applications marked as
      irrelevant or default are selectively excluded from certain data sets, streamlining focus on what's most
      important for business outcomes.
